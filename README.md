# HR-Dashboard
1. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze employee data to:

Identify factors influencing employee attrition

Understand patterns related to age, salary, department, job role, and work-life balance

Support data-driven HR decision-making

2. Dataset Collection

Used an HR Employee Attrition dataset (CSV format)

The dataset contains employee information such as:

Age

Gender

Department

Job Role

Monthly Income

Years at Company

3. Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

4. Data Loading

Loaded the dataset using pandas

Checked the structure of the data using:

.head()

.shape

.info()

5. Data Cleaning

Checked for missing values

Removed or handled unnecessary columns

Converted categorical variables where required

Ensured data types were correct for analysis

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed analysis to understand the data:

Overall attrition rate

Attrition by:

Department

Job Role

Gender

Age group

Monthly income

Work-life balance

Identified trends and patterns affecting attrition

7. Data Visualization

Created multiple visualizations to present insights clearly:

Bar charts for department-wise attrition

Pie charts for attrition percentage

Histograms for age and income distribution

Count plots for categorical features

These visualizations helped in understanding employee behavior visually.

8. Key Insights

Certain departments showed higher attrition rates

Employees with low work-life balance had higher attrition

Attrition was higher among employees with lower monthly income

Job role and years at company significantly impacted attrition

9. Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into employee attrition and highlights areas where HR teams can focus to reduce turnover.
The project demonstrates practical use of Python for real-world HR analytics.
